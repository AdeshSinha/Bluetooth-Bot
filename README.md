# Bluetooth-_Bot
A basic robotics project containing containing code about the working of a bluetooth controlled bot. 

The project contains Wireless Bluetooth Controlled Robot Car Using Arduino. The robotic car can be controlled wirelessly via a Smartphone. The smartphone has an Android app through which the user can send commands directly to Robot. The robot can move forward, backward, left, and right and can also be stopped.

The Arduinoâ€™s Bluetooth-controlled robot car is interfaced with a Bluetooth module. We can give specific commands to the robot through an Android app installed on the phone. At the receiving side, a Bluetooth transceiver module receives the commands and forwards them to the Arduino, and thus the robotic car is controlled.
